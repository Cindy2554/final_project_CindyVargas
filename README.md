# Project Summary
Show the effects of redevelopment on the change in demographics of income earners in the South Bronx neighborhood of New York City. Empahsize the change in proportion of lower income earners as redevelopment has occurred between the years of 2005-2019.

# Potential Story Arc

*Setup*: Redevelopment activities have intensified between the years 2005 and 2019 in the South Bronx.

*Conflcit*: This redevelopment has attracted higher income earners to settle in the South Bronx, pushing out lower income residents.

*Resolution*: Policies that will help retain affordable hosuing can help low income residents stay and benifit from redevelopment.

**User Story**: Major residential and commercial redevelopment of the South Bronx neighborhood has caused higher income earners to move there. The increase in rents correlated with this movement has effectively priced many long-term low-income earning residents out of their homes. As a reader, I want to know if these redevelopment trends are causing the discplacement of long-term low-income earning residents from the South Bronx so that I can take some action to advocate for them.

**Call to Action**: Push local policy makers to encourage policies that would either help these residents stay in the South Bronx or help them move to other areas that are affordable.

# Data Sources
I accessed New York City's Open Data site which is a free and publicly accessible website featuring a plethora of data sets from various New York City agencies. I uploaded New York City Census tracts (2010) to 


# Method and Medium
I plan to use Esri's Story Maps as the main digital platform to present my final project. Before uploading my project components to Esri's publicly accessible site, I plan to use ArcGIS Pro software to upload all my data sources and visualize the trends and variables of interest. I will focus on five-year time periods to make the visualizations more straight forward. Therefore, the time range of 2005-2019 will be broken up into three intervals; 2005-2009, 2010-2014, and 2015-2019.

I am looking to feature all of my variable of interest on the same map for each of these years. For analysis, they will be juxtaposed to each other. First, I would symbolize redevelopment locations with small house signs to differenitate them from the individual points indicating residents. South Bronx resident information related to demographics will be a point feature class separate from income. I hope to highlight changes in the proportion of demographic characteristics, like the race of residents, through a graduated color scale, effectively making a choropleth map. This way, viewers can see chaages in resident compostion over these time periods.

To show changes in median income specifically, I will use Rawgraphs to create a line graph or bar chart or some other time series visualization and add this to my Story Map. It will be overwhelming to show all the variables I want to focus on a map in ArcGIS so I plan to graph median income for residents in the South Bronx seapraetly to make my visualizations easier to digest. In terms of analytical tools on ArcGIS Pro, I plan to use the Hotspot tool to ultimately create a heat map that will show where changes in resident population and demography were concentrated in the South Bronx and see if the concentrations correlate to redevelopment sites.

I will add text in my Story Map explaining how the South Bronx was historically made up, when redevelopment started in earnest, genreal trends in the neighborhood and surrounding areas since then and information related to what happened to low income residents and their makeup. I am thinking of adding more context about what problems residentds are facing in being able to stay in the South Bronx as revedeopment happens, such as analyzing the  changes in the number of recipeints of Social services. I will also include an analysis of my findings and research on potential policy recommendations.
